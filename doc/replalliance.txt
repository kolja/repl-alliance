COMMANDS AND BINDINGS                               *replalliance-commands*

:RAconnect          asks for protocol, host and port and connects to a repl

:RAeval {expr}      sends {expr} to the repl

:RAdescribe         show Commands

:RAloadfile         (re-)evaluates file from the current buffer

<leader>e{motion}   sends the code from {motion} to the repl

<leader>e           in Visual mode: sends selection to the repl

<leader>E           prompts for code in the commandline

<leader>E           in Visual mode: prepopulates the prompt 
                    with code from selection

For example with |github.com/guns/vim-sexp| installed, you can `<leader>eaf`
to evaluate the form under the cursor, and `gvp` to replace it with whatever it
evaluated to.

CONNECT                                             *replalliance-connect*

Repl Alliance uses these variables for configuration:
>
    replPort = "59555"
    replServer = "127.0.0.1"
    replNamespace = "user"      initial namespace
    replProtocol = "nrepl"      either "nrepl" or "srepl"

    replVirtual = 1000          for how long to show virtual text
<

You can set the variables in your vimrc and call `require("nrepl").connect()` or pass the
values to `connect()` directly, like so:
>
    lua repl = require("nrepl").connect(<host>, <port> [,<namespace>])
